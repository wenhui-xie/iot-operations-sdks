//! MQTT client providing a managed connection with automatic reconnection across a single MQTT session.
//!
//! This module provides several key components for using an MQTT session:
//! * [`Session`] - Manages the lifetime of the MQTT session
//! * [`SessionManagedClient`] - Sends MQTT messages to the broker
//! * [`SessionPubReceiver`] - Receives MQTT messages from the broker
//! * [`SessionConnectionMonitor`] - Provides information about MQTT connection state
//! * [`SessionExitHandle`] - Allows the user to exit the session gracefully
//!
//! # [`Session`] lifespan
//! Each instance of [`Session`] is single use - after configuring a [`Session`], and creating any
//! other necessary components from it, calling the [`run`](crate::session::Session::run) method
//! will consume the [`Session`] and block (asynchronously) until the MQTT session shared between
//! client and broker ends. Note that a MQTT session can span multiple connects and disconnects to
//! the broker.
//!
//! The MQTT session can be ended one of three ways:
//! 1. The MQTT broker ends the MQTT session
//! 2. The [`ReconnectPolicy`](crate::session::reconnect_policy::ReconnectPolicy) configured on the
//!    [`Session`] halts reconnection attempts, causing the [`Session`] to end the MQTT session.
//! 3. The user uses the [`SessionExitHandle`] to end the MQTT session.
//!    <div class="warning">The SessionExitHandle currently only causes the exit of the Session client
//!    not the end of the MQTT session shared with the broker. This limitation will be fixed in future
//!    updates.</div>
//!
//! # Sending and receiving data over MQTT
//! A [`Session`] can be used to create a [`SessionManagedClient`] for sending data (i.e. outgoing
//! MQTT PUBLISH, MQTT SUBSCRIBE, MQTT UNSUBSCRIBE), and can in turn be used to create a
//! [`SessionPubReceiver`] for receiving incoming data (i.e. incoming MQTT PUBLISH).
//!
//! [`SessionPubReceiver`]s can be either filtered or unfiltered - a filtered receiver will only
//! receive messages that match a specific topic filter, while an unfiltered receiver will receive
//! all messages that do not match another existing filter.
//!
//! Note that in order to receive incoming data, you must both subscribe to the topic filter of
//! interest using the [`SessionManagedClient`] and create a [`SessionPubReceiver`] (filtered or
//! unfiltered). If an incoming message is received that
//! does not match any [`SessionPubReceiver`]s, it will be acknowledged to the MQTT broker and
//! discarded. Thus, in order to guarantee that messages will not be lost, you should create the
//! [`SessionPubReceiver`] *before* subscribing to the topic filter.
